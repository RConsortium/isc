# Contributing to the ISC [DRAFT]

## Contributing to R Consortium

If you're interested in contributing a project to the R Consortium, please open up an issue here for discussion: https://github.com/RConsortium/isc/issues

The full project grant proposal requirements is located [here](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/call-for-proposals).

## ISC Contributors

There has been a call from R Consortiumâ€™s Infrastructure Steering Committee (ISC) for additional contributors and expertise to help evaluate potential projects and contribute to the R Consortium. The R Consortium ISC will refine how to get involved over time, however, here are some possible ways to contribute:

* Tech due diligence for projects
* Time spent helping projects
* Liaison with GB
* R Consortium SIGs & working groups (various tasks)
* Technical content for website

If you are interested in engaging in this way, we would encourage you to issue a pull request to [TOC Contributors](https://github.com/RConsortium/isc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md) that you desire to become a ISC Contributor. Although there is not an actual limit of having one Contributor per company, we would encourage R Consortium member companies to designate an official TOC Contributor who is tasked with consulting internal experts and expressing a semi-official view on a given project.

This is not only about individual contribution.  It is also about rallying help from your employer, e.g., if you work for a R Consortium Member company. We're particularly interested in Contributors that can act as a focal point for tapping relevant expertise from their organizations and colleagues in order to engage with R Consortium discussions in a timely manner.

The ISC already has the pattern of encouraging non-members to make non-binding votes, so no change in the ISC charter is necessary to allow Contributors.

ISC [meetings](https://github.com/RConsortium/isc/blob/master/README.md#communication) are only two hours a month, which are mainly taken up with project presentations. While Contributors are welcome to share their views during the meeting, the biggest opportunity is to comment on the ISC [mailing list](https://lists.r-consortium.org/g/RConsortium-isc), on pull requests representing project applications and in voting.
