# R Consortium ISC

The role of the R Consortium Infrastructure Steering Committee (ISC) is to facilitate communication and collaboration among the Technical Projects. The ISC will be responsible for:

- coordinating collaboration among Technical Projects, including development of an overall technical vision for the community;
- making recommendations to the Governing Board of resource priorities for Technical Projects;
- electing annually a chairperson to preside over meetings, set the agenda for meetings, ensure meeting minutes are taken and who will also serve on the Governing Board as the ISCâ€™s representative (the "ISC Representative");
- creating, maintaining and amending project lifecycle procedures and processes, subject to the approval of the Governing Board; and
- such other matters related to the technical role of the ISC as may be communicated to the ISC by the Governing Board.
